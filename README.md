# Loan_Approval_Analysis
In this comprehensive data science project, I tackled a rich dataset featuring a variety of variables including loan information, borrower demographics, asset values, and credit scores. Here's a detailed breakdown of my journey:

🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: The project began with meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing. I handled missing values, standardized data formats, and created new features to enhance our dataset. This critical step ensured that our data was robust and ready for analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Next, I dove into EDA to uncover underlying patterns and insights. Visualizations and descriptive statistics helped me understand the distribution of variables, relationships between them, and detect any anomalies. This stage provided valuable context and guided subsequent analysis steps.
🧪 Statistical Testing: To delve deeper into the data, I performed various statistical tests. A t-test was employed to compare the means of different groups, while ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) helped in understanding the differences across multiple groups. These tests were essential in identifying significant variables influencing loan status.

🔗 Correlation Analysis: I conducted correlation analysis to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables. This analysis was crucial in identifying potential predictors and multicollinearity issues, ensuring the reliability of our predictive models.

📈 Logistic Regression Modeling: The final stage involved building and fine-tuning a logistic regression model to predict loan status. This model leveraged the insights gained from previous analyses to accurately classify loan outcomes, providing actionable insights for financial decision-making.

This project highlights my skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, showcasing a methodical approach to transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. Looking forward to connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals to share insights and learnings from this project!
